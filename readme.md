# What is this Repository
This is my personal sandpit for learning and exploring my programming skills in **Python**.
This is largely focus on maintaining a history of odd projects I have taken that have no goal apart from learning and developing skills. Currently this consists of:
1) Advent of Code: https://adventofcode.com/
2) Python Daily Challenges: https://pythonprinciples.com/challenges

Note: this repository is very unlikely to be of interest to anyone else, but thanks for stopping by!
